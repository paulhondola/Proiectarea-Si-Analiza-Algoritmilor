/*
A sports tournament organizer needs to manage elimination brackets for 64 teams.
Each match eliminates one team, and winners advance to the next round until a
champion is determined. The system must efficiently:

Track which teams advance at each round
Determine the path any team took to reach their final position
Calculate the minimum number of matches needed
Find all teams that were eliminated by the eventual winner
Design an algorithm to represent this tournament structure and implement
functions to answer queries about team progression and match outcomes.
