/*
A social media platform wants to analyze user connections to understand
community formation. Given friendship data between users, the platform needs to:

Identify isolated groups of friends who have no connections to other groups
Determine the size of the largest friend circle
Find users who could serve as bridges between different communities
Calculate how many separate social clusters exist in the network
You are provided with a dataset of user friendships where each friendship is
bidirectional. Design an algorithm to analyze these social connections and
answer queries about community structure.
