/*
A city planning department needs to connect all neighborhoods to essential
utilities (water, electricity, gas) at minimum cost. They have cost estimates
for running utility lines between different areas, including:

Installation costs that vary based on terrain and distance
The requirement that all neighborhoods must be connected (directly or
indirectly) Budget constraints requiring the most economical solution The need
to ensure no redundant connections that don't reduce total cost Given the cost
matrix for connecting different neighborhoods, design an algorithm to determine
the minimum cost to connect the entire city to utilities. Compare different
approaches and analyze which is more efficient for this specific application.
