/*
A search engine needs to implement an autocomplete feature for millions of
search queries. Users type partial queries and expect to see the most relevant
completions instantly. The system must:

Handle prefix matching for any partial input
Return the top 10 most frequent completions for each prefix
Support real-time updates when new search terms become popular
Efficiently store queries that share common prefixes
Given a dataset of search queries with their frequency counts, design an
algorithm to build and query this autocomplete system. Consider memory
efficiency since common prefixes like "how to" appear in thousands of queries.
